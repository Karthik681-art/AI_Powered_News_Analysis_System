# AI_Powered_News_Analysis_System
This project is an AI-powered Police News Intelligence Dashboard developed as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) during a 24-hour hackathon. It automatically generates a daily news digest focused on law enforcement relevance. The system filters English-language news articles based on district and topic importance, as guided by senior police officers.

Key features include:

Filtering and organizing relevant news from multiple sources

Clustering articles by topic for better insight

Comparative summaries to view how the same event is reported across sources

Historical context by attaching related news from the past 7 days

Excludes future-dated articles, showing only present and past news

The digest is presented through a clean, simple web dashboard. This project is a foundational step toward empowering police departments with AI-assisted decision-making tools.
